# My Port Scanner Project: Internship Portfolio

## Objectives
The main objectives of my Port Scanner Project were:

- **Understanding Network Security:** To gain a deep understanding of network security by studying the methods and tools used for port scanning.
- **Practical Application:** To practically implement port scanning techniques and assess network vulnerabilities.
- **Ethical and Responsible Practices:** To ensure that all scanning activities were conducted ethically and responsibly, adhering to legal and ethical standards.
- **Risk Assessment:** To identify potential vulnerabilities in network systems through port scanning and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Project Features
This project primarily focused on the following features:

- **Port Scanning Techniques:** I explored various port scanning techniques, including SYN, TCP Connect, and UDP scanning methods.
- **Network Enumeration:** I learned how to identify open ports and services running on a target system.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** I evaluated potential security risks associated with open ports and services and analyzed their potential impact.

## Methodology and Ethics
My project methodology and ethical considerations were as follows:

- **Ethical Scanning:** All scanning activities were conducted in a controlled environment, ensuring that no unauthorized systems were targeted.
- **Informed Consent:** I followed ethical guidelines by obtaining informed consent from participants for any scanning activities.
- **Legality:** The project strictly adhered to legal regulations, focusing solely on educational purposes and not involving any unauthorized or malicious actions.

## Key Takeaways
This project provided me with significant insights:

- **Network Security Expertise:** I gained practical knowledge of port scanning techniques, enhancing my comprehension of network security assessment.
- **Ethical Considerations:** I developed a strong awareness of the importance of conducting ethical and responsible scanning practices.
- **Risk Identification:** Through vulnerability assessment, I learned to identify potential risks and recommend appropriate security measures.
